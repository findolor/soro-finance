These are all the important rules that you must follow before developing anything for this project.

1. Check [project-description.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-description.mdc) to see what we are building and why, this will give you enough context while you are working on development.

2. Before starting out development, always check [tech-stack.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tech-stack.mdc) to see which technologies we are using.

3. When working on a project, always check the checklist [checklist.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/checklist.mdc) to see our current progress.
